# untitledProject

**Description**

This untitledProject is an on-going proof of concept. Currently in alpha.

**Motivation**

There relationship between React Native and traditional servers is poorly documented. Wanted to created boilerplate code for everyone interested in developing in React Native (not create-react-native app, not EXPOnent).

**Backend Setup**

See /backend README.md


**Client Setup**

1) Running `npm install` in the root folder will install the following npm packages:

    *devDependencies*
    * npm install babel-jest ^23.4.0
    * npm install babel-preset-react-native ^5
    * npm install jest ^23.4.0
    * npm react-test-renderer ^16.4.1

    *dependencies*
    * npm install react ^16.4.1
    * npm install react-native ^0.56.0
    * npm install react-native-safari-view ^2.1.0
    * npm install react-native-vector-icons ^4.6.0

2) Running `react-native run-ios` will run the app in an iPhone 6 Plus environment by default. You can run app in a device such as iPhone 8 Plus by running `react-native run-ios --simulator 'iPhone 8 Plus'`.
